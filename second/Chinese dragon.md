Hello distinguished judges
Today, I’m honored to share one of the most iconic symbols of Chinese culture—Chinese dragon! This majestic creature serves as a meaningful symbol and profound spirit. Let’s explore what the dragon represents as a cultural icon and powerful spirit, and how they influence our present and shape our future.

On the one hand, Chinese dragon is a cultural symbol that resonates deeply with China's ancient history, reflected in many festivals and myths. During the Spring Festival, Chinese people perform vibrant dragon dances to seek good fortune, while during the Dragon Boat Festival, they hold dragon boat races, highlighting the dragon's role as a symbol of cooperation. Moreover, the tale of the Dragon King, ruler of the seas and controller of rain, illustrates the dragon’s strength and authority, as villagers prayed and offered sacrifices during droughts, believing his favor could bring life-giving rain to save crops.

On the other hand, the dragon's spirit embodies innovation and openness as China engages with the global community. The Jiaolong submersible, named after the mythical dragon, showcases China's deep-sea exploration breakthroughs, symbolizing the innovative spirit of Chinese scientific team. Similarly, the Belt and Road Initiative, connecting over 140 countries, represents China's vision for global cooperation and shared prosperity, akin to the Dragon King's blessings for bountiful harvests.

In conclusion, Chinese dragon is a meaningful symbol of our cultural identity, embodying abundance, solidarity, and strength through its rich traditions and myths. Plus, its spirit of innovation and openness reflects China's dynamic role in the global community. Let us honor this legacy, inherit its spirit, and build a shared future for mankind!
