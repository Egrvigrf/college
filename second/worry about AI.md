Dear Alex It's natural for people to worry that AI would replace them in job market, so don't worry.

In recent years, the capacity of AI has been dramatically enhanced and various AI models emerged, for example, chatgpt4. It's not groundless that many people have the worry as these AI models seem too powerful to tackle everything for people. From writing an article to make PPTs, whatever your requirements are, you simply typing them in and few seconds later you will be astonished by the perfect reply generated by AI. 

However, despite its amazing ability in tackling daily tasks, AI still have its demerits. Primarily, AI can't actually understand your questions and its replies are made according to AI algorithm and massive dates inputted. That means when questions getting more and more tricky, the accuracy and proficiency of replies are declining noticeably. And you may spot some answers are logical at first scan but extreme ridiculous after you dived into them.

Moreover, AI can't generate creative ideas. What AI can do is to rearrange known information and generated most related answer. Besides, the rise of AI created lots of new positions regarding investigating and applying AI technologies. You can embrace new jobs if some jobs are replaced. Some jobs, monotonic and less innovative, maybe take over by AI first. You can improve your core values such as communication and creative thinking to avoid the thread of AI taking over you. 

In conclusion, AI is powerful tool and may take some tedious jobs, but simultaneously new positions popped. Try to embrace new jobs and improve your ability that AI don't embody can earn you a steady position in job market.


AI 修改

Dear Alex,
It's understandable to feel concerned about AI potentially replacing jobs in the market, but there's no need to worry too much.

In recent years, AI's capabilities have advanced rapidly, with various models, such as ChatGPT-4, emerging. Many people are understandably anxious as these AI systems seem incredibly powerful, able to handle everything from writing articles to creating presentations. You simply type in a request, and within seconds, AI generates responses that can be surprisingly accurate.

However, despite its remarkable abilities, AI still has its limitations. First, it doesn't truly understand the questions it processes; it relies on algorithms and vast amounts of data to provide answers. As questions become more complex, the accuracy and quality of its responses tend to decline. Sometimes, an answer might appear logical at first glance but reveals significant flaws upon closer inspection. Additionally, AI cannot generate genuinely creative ideas. It rearranges known information rather than producing original thoughts.

Moreover, the rise of AI has created new job opportunities, particularly in fields related to AI research and development. While some monotonous and less innovative jobs may be replaced by AI, there are many areas where human skills, such as communication and creative thinking, are irreplaceable. By focusing on improving these core skills, you can avoid the threat of being replaced by AI.

In conclusion, while AI is indeed a powerful tool capable of taking over some repetitive jobs, it also opens up new opportunities. By embracing these changes and focusing on skills that AI cannot replicate, such as creativity and communication, you can secure a stable position in the evolving job market.


Dear Alex,

I am glad to have the honor to read your post and distinctive perspective. To mitigate your worries, I would like to share with you my own stances on this issue.

As far as I am concerned, there is no need for you to be plagued by such an AI-related problem. Admittedly, AI is definitely advancing by leaps and bounds in this day and era, which seems quite overbearing and fearsome to some extent. However, just as Gandhi eloquently stated, "Nothing comes with only one side", the burgeoning growth of AI is bound to endow us with novel opportunities and brilliant prospects.

First, there must have emerged an enormous amount of newly-provided working positions and professions. As proof, the social demands for AI construction staff and also programmers specializing in AI is springing up like mushrooms these days. In that case, you can properly direct your attention towards these brand-new spheres of occupations and adapt your future career planning to the latest job market trend so as to make it much more compatible with corporate requirements and keep yourself exceedingly competitive in labor market.
 
Besides, you, as a person, also possess certain advantages that simply cannot be outpaced by AI. Just as Voltaire observed, "Aesthetics is the main source of human characteristics and our unique features ", all of those industries concerning high-brow art and delicate design cannot engage AI in the process due to its deficiency in "artistic cells". In other words, these industries are only available for humanity owing to its irreplaceable needs of “human touch”， which implies that these are areas that never allow the interference from AI and you can concentrate your attentiveness on them.

All in all, facing the AI"intrusion", as long as you keep poised and forge ahead with all of your merits and perceptions which are human-exclusive and two qualities of resilience and fortitude, you will be bound to be well-positioned and thus rest assured in your anticipated prospect.

Best wishes!
